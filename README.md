# sickkids-igt-vr
This is the Unity Project Folder for the IGT and CHISIL collaboration for the effect of Virtual Environments on Pain.

This was a project that I developed in collaboration with Dr.Clyde Matava at Sickkids Hospital in Toronto Canada hoping to decrease the use of general anesthetic during IGT procedures.
